Our goal is to produce a working CLI client for the clickup API
- Study the codebase to see what is already implemented.
- Study files in @clickup-api-docs/ to know what the API supports
- Prioritize what you think a user would be most likely to want to do in clickup as the next feature
- Track progress in TODO.md with simple items per endpoint / functionality. No details
- Use TDD to implement new features: always write a test first, then implement
- If you need data in clickup for testing, you can create it with curl using CLICKUP_API_KEY as the key
- Document the new added commands
- Commit when finished with a succint one line message
