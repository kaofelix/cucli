Our goal is to produce a working CLI client for the clickup API
- Study the codebase to see what is already implemented.
- Study files in @clickup-api-docs/ to know what the API supports
- Prioritize what you think a user would be most likely to want to do in clickup as the next feature
- Track progress in TODO.md with simple items per endpoint / functionality. No details
- Use TDD to implement new features: always write a test first, then implement
- If you need data in clickup for testing, you can create it with curl using CLICKUP_API_KEY as the key
- The environment is pointing to a test ClickUp Workspace, it's ok to make changes for testing scenario and cassette recording
- Only use VCR for a few happy test integration scenarios
- If test files grow too large, break them down into smaller files
- Document the new added commands
- If the documentation grows too large, break it down into smaller files
- Commit when finished with a succint one line message
