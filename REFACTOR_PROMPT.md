We are working on refactoring cucli

- Study @REFACTORING_PATTERNS.md
- Pick a refactor to work on. Introduce a new pattern or apply a pattern to an existing function
- Track your work on REFACTOR_STATUS.md
- Run all tests after each refactor
- If green, commit with a succint one line message

## General Guidelines

- Source files are in `src/`
- Only change source files, never change tests
